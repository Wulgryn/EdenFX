# Pandora Engine
This is my game engine, if you can't find anything in master branch that means I still testing stuffs. It is recommended to check the test braches, these wont be commented as much as i plan the main branch.

I will also try to add some unique rendering system, as well compressing system.

Future plans:<p>
<p>- reworked rendering system
<p>- reworked compressing system
<p>- some type of AI
<p>- like nvidia surround, but inbuilt and with mixed resolution
<p>- full graphical interface
<p>- c# support (with the choice of C#/C++)
