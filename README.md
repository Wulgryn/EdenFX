## Latest info

It has no documentation, because it's an experimental release.<br>
But you can still use it. In <b>[src/main.cpp](https://github.com/Wulgryn/Pandora-Engine/blob/main/src/main.cpp)</b> you can see some example code. Also in <b>[src/test.cpp](https://github.com/Wulgryn/Pandora-Engine/blob/main/src/test.cpp)</b>.

## About
This is my game engine. <p> It is recommended to check the other branches, because I only merge with <br>the <b>[main](https://github.com/Wulgryn/Pandora-Engine/tree/main)</b> branch  if I finish the changes in other branch I am working on.

## How to use

Coming soon...


<br>

## Future plans:
<p>- reworked rendering system
<br>- reworked compressing system
<br>- some type of AI
<br>- like nvidia surround, but inbuilt and with mixed resolution
<br>- full graphical interface
<br>- c# support (with the choice of C#/C++)
<p> I will also try to add some unique rendering system, as well as compressing system.
