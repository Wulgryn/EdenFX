### About
This is my game engine. <p>I am working on this as a hobby. Feel free to fix any bug or error if you would like to.

### What is it trying to be?
Beside a game engine it will be an all included API with not only UI, IO and NET management, but also with built in trainable AI.<br>
That is why I make it separate, so that it can be used as an individual API.

## Latest info

## Future plans:
<p>- reworked rendering system
<br>- reworked compressing system
<br>- some type of AI
<br>- like nvidia surround, but inbuilt and with mixed resolution
<br>- full graphical interface
<br>- c# support (with the choice of C#/C++)
<p> I will also try to add some unique rendering system, as well as compressing system.
